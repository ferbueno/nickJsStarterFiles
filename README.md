# Nick JS Starter Files

 This is how the base case of NickJS should look in your directory. This has just been adapted to fit for the demo [available here](https://nickjs.org/).

 Thanks to Phantombuster for their library.

## Usage
 1. Download the repo (clone, fork or download the zip...whatever you prefer)
 2. Run `npm install`
 3. Export Chrome's path to your environment. E.g. `export CHROME_PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"`
 4. Run `node index.js`
 

### Happy coding!
